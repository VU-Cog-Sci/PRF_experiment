# REvL
experimental software for reversal learning experiment, using psychopy as a backend and pygaze for the eyetracking.

`constants.py` allows one to set the parameters of the experiment. The present settings are for a relatively easy, fast-switching and brief experiment (60 trials, moderately short ITIs). 

Eye tracking should work, but hasn't been tested.
