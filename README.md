experimental software for prf experiment, using psychopy as a backend.

# TODO

* make sure all messages are entered correctly, this includes Quest messages, event messages, trial messages, etc.
* check out Quest progress by analyzing the staircase trajectories. 
* attempt to recruit iohub functionality to access the eyelink. For this, see the demo in PsychoPy.
* make the parameters for the trials contain as much information as possible, and for these:
- make sure that parameters don't contain strings, as they do now, but only floating-point numbers
